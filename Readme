9/15/16:  Democratic Volunteer Center code distribution system.

This is a git repository for Ubuntu code developed in support of the
phone bank system at the Democratic Volunteer Center (DVC) in
Mountain View, CA.  The phone bank is comprised of 50 Dell laptops 
running Ubuntu, skype and firefox that are interfaced 
to various databases provided by the Democratic party.

Elements of the code and configuration of those laptops are stored 
and distributed from github.com/demvolctr.  This includes our version
of /etc/rc.local that calls install.bash every time the laptops are
rebooted.  This script does a 'git pull' to retrieve the latest 
version of the code from github.com.  If /etc/rc.local or any files 
in /usr/local/bin have been changed since the last 'git pull,' the
new versions are copied into their correct destinations.
