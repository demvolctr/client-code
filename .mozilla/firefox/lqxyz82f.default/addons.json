Moreover, I found that the vast majority of them were either too primitive or just overkill for me. I was never able to find a tool that struck a balance between the two and did exactly what I wanted, which led me on the adventurous road to developing Autofill. Even if you're happy with your current form filler, you may still want to install this add-on if you want even more convenience (one less click), automation (autofills / autoselects / autochecks), and power (supports variables and RegExp pattern-matching) at your fingertips. Autofill is partly inspired by the LastPass online password manager's \"Custom fields\" tab.\n\nAfter installation, go to the Autofill Options panel (Tools menu / Add-ons / Extensions) to define form fields to autofill. Click on the Help button for a description of each setting. Please submit bug reports, suggestions, feature requests, and general feedback at the official Autofill support page:\n\nhttp://groups.google.com/group/firefox-autofill\n\nAlso feel free to leave a mini review here.
